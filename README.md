# EEC 270 Project: Fingerprinting Websites

This repo contains the source code of our automatic data generation scripts, jupyter notebook DNN models training scripts, and all the data we used for our project.

## Introduction

In this project, we are trying to build machine learning, especially deep learning models to identify selected target websites given hardware events monitored by Linux Perf as features.

## Content

* data: contains the final csv files for training and testing
* sample_output: contains the raw files of data generated by Perf, named afer `classLabel_numOfTrace.txt`
* generate_data.py: generate target websites' data
* generate_openworld.py: generate additional non-sensitive data
* sample.py: combine the data in raw txt files into closed world dataset csv files
* sample_openworld.py: combine the data in raw txt files into open world dataset csv files
* websites.json: contains the top 30 target websites we used from Alexa top websites
* top-1m.csv: top 1 million websites, used for generate open world data, you can download it from [here](https://gist.github.com/chilts/7229605). Please put it under the root directory.
* 270ProjectDL.ipynb: contains the dnn models' source code for building DNN, training, testing on closed world dataset
* 270ProjectDL_OpenWorld.ipynb: contain the dnn models' source code for building DNN, training, testing on open world dataset
